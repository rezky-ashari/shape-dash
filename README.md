## 🎮 Game Overview

Control a shapeshifting cube (or sphere... or triangle!) and navigate through a procedurally generated world filled with spikes, pits, and cliffs.

*   **Survive**: Jump over spikes and gaps. The speed is constant, but the challenge never stops.
*   **Characters**: Choose from 3 unique shapes, each with its own physics and style:
    *   **Square**: A classic, solid slide.
    *   **Circle**: A rolling ball with Pac-Man inspired visuals.
    *   **Triangle**: A fast-spinning, pointy daredevil.
*   **Physics**: Experience satisfying arcade physics with forceful jumps, gravity, and explosive deaths.

## 🕹️ Controls

| Action | Key(s) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Jump** | `Space`, `Up Arrow`, or `Left Click` |
| **Restart (Game Over)** | `Space` |
| **Main Menu** | Click the button or Refresh |

## ✨ Features

*   **Infinite Procedural Levels**: No two runs are the same. The world generates endlessly with varied segments (flats, gaps, cliffs).
*   **Dynamic Visuals**:
    *   **Particle Explosions**: Watch your character shatter into pieces with "fireworks" physics and matched colors upon death.
    *   **Camera Shake**: Feel the impact of every crash.
*   **Persistent High Score**: Your best distance is saved locally so you can always try to beat your record.
*   **Polished UX**: Smooth scene transitions, clear UI, and instant restarts.
